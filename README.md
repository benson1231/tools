[![Tests](https://github.com/benson1231/tools/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/benson1231/tools/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)

This repository documents a collection of **data science and computer science tools**, including their core concepts, command-line usage, and representative outputs.
It also provides runnable environments for hands-on experimentation, and a GitHub Pages–hosted website for quick reference and command lookup:

## Repository Structure and Design Philosophy

This repository adopts a **decoupled architecture** that clearly separates **computation**, **artifacts**, and **presentation**.

* **`scripts/`**
  Contains all executable source code (e.g., Bash, R, and Python scripts). These scripts are intended to be run independently of the website build process and are responsible for generating analysis results, figures, and reports.

* **`website/assets/`**
  Serves as a read-only artifact store for the website. Outputs generated by scripts—such as rendered HTML reports, figures, and tables—are written here and consumed by the website for visualization.

* **`website/docs/`**
  Contains Quarto (`.qmd`) files used for documentation, tutorials, and methodological explanations. These files do not execute analysis code; instead, they describe workflows and reference pre-generated outputs from `website/assets/`.

With this design, **all computation is fully decoupled from presentation**.
Quarto and GitHub Actions are used exclusively for rendering documentation and visualizing existing results, ensuring stable CI builds, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability.
