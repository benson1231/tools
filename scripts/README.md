# Scripts

This directory contains the **source code for data processing and analysis workflows**.  
All scripts in this folder are designed to be executed directly (e.g., via the command line or batch scripts).

The `html` outputs generated by these scripts are written to the `website/assets/` directory, where they are subsequently consumed by Quarto for website rendering and visualization.

This design enforces a clear separation between **computation** and **presentation**, ensuring that analytical workflows remain independent of the website build process.
